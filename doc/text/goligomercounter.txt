                                goligomercounter
Function

   Counts the number of given oligomers in a sequence

Description

   goligomercounter counts the number of oligomers in a sequence (by windows
   optionally). Oligomer can be specified using degenerate nucleotide alphabet,
   or by regular expressions. k-mers can be counted by specifying the "-length"
   qualifier.
